    <p>
        In Jaipur, each player has a hand of cards with various (color-coded) goods on them. Each player also has a stack of camel cards (their "herd") which is not considered part of their hand. There are five cards face-up between the players  that are available for the players to take.
    </p>
    <p>
        On your turn, you take one of three actions:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Take</b> a single card or all the camels in the face up row.
            <dl>
                <dd>
                    You may take any single goods card from the card row and add it to your hand, or take all the camels in the row and add them to your herd.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    You are limited to having 7 goods cards in your hand, so you may not take a goods card if you already have 7 goods cards in your hand. (Again, your herd does not count toward this limit.)
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    The card row is then replenished from the deck so it always has 5 cards at the start of a turn.
                </dd>
            </dl>
        </li>
        <li><b>Trade</b> for 2 or more goods cards from the row.
            <dl>
                <dd>
                    You may trade goods cards from your hand or camels from your herd for goods cards from the card row. For every one card you trade from your hand or herd, you may pick up one goods card from the row and add it to your hand.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    The cards your traded are added to the card row, so it will still have 5 cards.
                </dd>
            </dl>
        </li>
        <li><b>Sell</b> cards to earn points.
            <dl>
                <dd>
                    You may sell one or more cards to earn points, but all the cards you sell must be the same color.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    If you are selling Ruby, Gold, or Silver (the red, yellow, and gray cards) you MUST sell at least two cards.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    Regardless of the type of good, each card you sell lets you take one token of the corresponding color from the bank, starting from the most valuable token.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    If you sell 3 or more goods, you also earn a bonus token from the corresponding pile (for sales of 3,4, or 5+ goods).
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    The sold goods cards are discarded.
                </dd>
            </dl>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The game continues until either:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Three piles of goods tokens are depleted; OR
        </li>
        <li>The card row cannot be replenished.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <dl>
        <dd>At that point, players total the points they have on their earned goods tokens and bonus tokens.
        </dd>
        <dd>In addition, whichever player has more camels in their herd at the end of the round earns the camel bonus token, worth 5 points.
        </dd>
        <dd>Whichever player earns more points total wins the round.
        </dd>
    </dl>
